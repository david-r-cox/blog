I'm interested in many topics including [optimization](https://reason.ing), [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), [complex systems](https://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/~mdennehy/HowComplexSystemsFail.pdf), and [security](https://success.cse.tamu.edu/people/).

Current work:
- Accelerating NP-complete computing at [Integrated Reasoning](https://integrated-reasoning.com) [(YC S22)](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/integrated-reasoning).
  - [The biggest moonshots in YC’s S22 batch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/08/the-biggest-moonshots-in-ycs-s22-batch/), ([Kyle Wiggers](https://twitter.com/kyle_l_wiggers), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/))

Previously:
- A [memory control system introduced in iOS 15](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220391301A1/en) that leverages dynamic programming to ensure a snappy UX when changing apps under resource pressure.
- [CLP(FD)](https://www.swi-prolog.org/man/clpfd.html) solvers for a variety of [integer problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), including a handful of puzzles involving [Zoombinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoombinis).
- Haskell libraries for performing inference in massive [Bayesian Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) and [Markov Random Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field) using [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling).
- Algorithms for quantifying file similarity and facilitating fast recall of data with similar [information density](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) patterns.
- Anti-malware [signatures](https://eclecticlight.co/tag/xprotect/), [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramnit) of which have been in [production](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) since [2015](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/wildfire).

My goal for this blog is to concretize things that I spend time reflecting on. As a writer-in-a-hurry, I'll be occasionally augmenting my own writing with curated excerpts from conversations I've had with [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2). For the record, I managed to write this page myself and have not yet been replaced by the robots.

Please feel welcome to reach out anytime to say [hey](mailto:david_cox@hey.com)!
